### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher in plant and insect genomics. I am interested in variant calling, single cell transcriptomics, epigenetics, genetic mapping, and quantitative genetics. I have created reproducible codes and pipelines for performing variant calling and analysing differential gene expression.
