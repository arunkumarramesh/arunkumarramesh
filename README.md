### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher in plant and insect genomics. 

I am interested in genomics, single cell transcriptomics, epigenetics, and quantitative genetics. 

My Github hosts repositories containing annotated pipelines and input data for variant calling, genetic mapping, and analysing differential gene expression.
